# ProteinBiophysics
This repository includes libraries to analyze structural biology data. 

- CD_library: analize raw Ciruclar Dicroism .csv files acquired in JASCO J-1500 spectrophotometer. This library contains three different classes depending if the files come from a single spectra acquisition, temperature data interval or single wavelength melting curves.

- Tutorials: folder with tutorial notebooks and files to learn how to use each library. CD library tutorial available the following notebook: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/francobiglione/ProteinBiophysics/blob/main/CD_tutorial.ipynb)
